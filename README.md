An example of if statement parsing for machine-readability and human-readability.

Load hif.html into a browser and click the "Transpile to Machine Readable Syntax" button.

The code parses the test text and displays it in the 'output' area.

Then, the code from the 'output' area is re-parsed using the 'ifbox' grammar and a status is displayed ("regression test OK").
